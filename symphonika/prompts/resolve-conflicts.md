# Resolve merge conflicts for issue #{{issue.number}}

You are running autonomously inside the existing issue workspace at
`{{workspace.path}}` on branch `{{branch.name}}`. The open pull request
from this branch has merge conflicts against `main` and cannot be merged.
Your job is to resolve those conflicts, push, and exit.

## What to do

**Use the pm-autofix-pr skill to fix the conflicts on the pull request for
branch `{{branch.name}}`** — its trigger set includes "fix the build" and
"iterate on pr", which covers conflict resolution.

Concretely:

1. `git fetch origin main`.
2. Rebase or merge `origin/main` into `{{branch.name}}`. Prefer rebase
   unless the branch history would be destructive to reviewers.
3. Resolve each conflict by preserving the intent of both changes. When
   resolution requires a judgment call, choose the most defensible option
   and document it in a `gh pr comment` after the push.
4. Run the local quality gate — a green gate is the proof that your
   resolution did not silently break behavior.
5. Force-push the rebased branch (`git push --force-with-lease`) only if
   you rebased. If you merged, push normally.

Discover the PR with `gh pr list --head {{branch.name}} --state open` if
you need the PR number. Stay on branch `{{branch.name}}`. Do not open a
second PR.

## Constraints

- Unattended run; no operator will respond mid-run.
- Use the local `gh` CLI for every GitHub mutation. Do **not** call the
  GitHub MCP connector tools.
- Do not modify operational labels in the `sym:*` namespace.
- If conflicts are genuinely unresolvable without a product decision,
  post a `gh pr comment` describing what blocked you, then **write
  `BLOCKED.md` in the workspace root** (uncommitted) with the same
  explanation and exit 0. A Bash tool call's `exit 1` only ends that
  subshell, not the provider session, so it cannot make `provider_success`
  false — exiting non-zero here would silently return the FSM to
  `wait_for_pr`, which would observe the same `mergeable: false` signal and
  route straight back into this state, an infinite loop. Writing
  `BLOCKED.md` is what the FSM actually gates this state's advance on. Do
  not self-apply `sym:human-needed`.

## Exit

Exit 0 once the rebase/merge is clean and pushed, and no `BLOCKED.md`
exists in the workspace. The orchestrator will re-check `mergeable` on the
next tick and route accordingly.
